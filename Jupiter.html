<h1> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in our solar system. It is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, meaning it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Its atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.

  Jupiter has a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere, which is the largest contiguous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Jupiter has 95 known moons, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto</h1>
