    Earth is our home planet and the third planet from the Sun. It is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of about 8,000 miles. Earth is often called the “Goldilocks planet” because it has just the right conditions for life to exist, with a moderate climate and liquid water on its surface.

Earth is a terrestrial planet, meaning it is a rocky planet with a solid surface. It has a strong magnetic field that protects us from harmful solar radiation and an atmosphere that helps regulate temperature and weather patterns. Earth is also unique in that it has a large natural satellite, the Moon, which affects tides and stabilizes the tilt of Earth’s axis.

Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, which is why we have leap years to keep our calendars in sync with the astronomical year. It takes Earth 24 hours to rotate on its axis, giving us day and night. Earth’s axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees, which causes the seasons as Earth orbits the Sun.
