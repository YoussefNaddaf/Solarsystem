<h1>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the Red Planet because of its reddish appearance due to the iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is a cold, dusty, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it’s the only planet where we’ve sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.

Mars has a rocky surface that has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement, and chemical reactions. It has seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids.

NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars. The Perseverance rover is the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world and touched down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021</h1>
