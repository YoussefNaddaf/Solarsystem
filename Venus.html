<h1>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s twin because it is similar in size and density. However, there are many differences between the two planets. Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and is perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect2. This makes it the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead.

Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system. This means that on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite to what we experience on Earth. Venus has no natural satellites and has been explored by numerous spacecraft from various space agencies, including NASA’s Magellan, which mapped the planet’s surface with radar</h1>
