  Neptune is the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun. It is dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds. Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations. It is more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is an ice giant, meaning most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of “icy” materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core. Its atmosphere is made up mostly of molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, and methane.

Neptune has 14 known moons which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology. It also has at least five main rings and four more ring arcs, which are clumps of dust and debris likely formed by the gravity of a nearby moon. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.
