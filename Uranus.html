    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. Saturn has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but it is over 95 times more massive.

Saturn is adorned with a dazzling, complex system of icy rings, which makes it unique in our solar system. The other giant planets have rings, but none are as spectacular as Saturn’s. Saturn’s interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer.

Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn’s planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth’s, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn’s larger size.
