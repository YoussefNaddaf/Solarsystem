  <h1>Mercury</h1>
  <p>
    Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet
    with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere
    (called an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030
    mi), 38% of that of Earth’s, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars1.
    <br />
    <br />
    Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth’s and has no natural satellites.
    According to current theories, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a
    deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury has surface
    temperatures that change wildly during the day, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800
    °F) during sunlight across the equator regions At Mercury’s poles though, there are large reservoirs of water ices
    that are never exposed to direct sunlight, which has an estimated mass of about 0.025–0.25% the Antarctic ice sheet
