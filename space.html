      <h2>The Sun</h2>
      <p>The Sun is the center of our solar system and is by far the largest object in it. It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the entire solar system. The Sun is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.</p>
